I made an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe Bot using the mini-max algorithm used in problems going from an initial state to a terminal state (the place you want to be). A real world example is a gps. You start at one place and get directions to reach your destination (terminal state).

To play with my bot:
1. Download my project
2. Open your terminal & open up the folder with my code in the terminal
3. Run "python runner.py"
